This project covers Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and spaCy.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
1.Classical Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species Dataset
Goal: Predict the species of iris flowers based on sepal and petal features.
Key Steps:

Data preprocessing: handled missing values and encoded categorical labels.

Model training: implemented a Decision Tree Classifier.

Model evaluation: calculated accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deliverable: Python script / Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

2. Deep Learning with TensorFlow / PyTorch

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Goal: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits.
Key Steps:

Built a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.

Trained and evaluated the model, achieving over 95% test accuracy.

Visualized model predictions on 5 sample test images.
Deliverable: Well-commented code showing model structure, training loop, and evaluation.

3. Natural Language Processing with spaCy

Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews
Goal: Extract entities (brands, product names) and perform rule-based sentiment analysis.
Key Steps:

Used spaCyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify products and organizations.

Implemented a rule-based sentiment analyzer for positive/negative classification.

Displayed sample outputs showing extracted entities and sentiment results.
Deliverable: Python script / Jupyter notebook with code and sample output.
